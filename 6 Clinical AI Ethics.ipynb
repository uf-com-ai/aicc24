    "# Introduction to the Ethics of AI in Medicine\n",
    "Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for the practice of public health and medicine. To fully reap the benefits of AI, ethical challenges for healthcare systems, practitioners and beneficiaries of medical and public health services must be addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether AI can advance the interests of patients and communities depends on a collective effort to design and implement ethically defensible laws and policies and ethically designed AI technologies. There are also potential serious negative consequences if ethical principles and human rights obligations are not prioritized by those who fund, design, regulate or use AI technologies for health. AI’s opportunities and challenges are thus inextricably linked.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI can augment the ability of health-care providers to improve patient care, provide accurate diagnoses, optimize treatment plans, support pandemic preparedness and response, inform the decisions of health policy-makers or allocate resources within health systems. To unlock this potential, health-care workers and health systems must have detailed information on the contexts in which such systems can function safely and effectively, the conditions necessary to ensure reliable, appropriate use, and the mechanisms for continuous auditing and assessment of system performance. Health- care workers and health systems must have access to education and training in order to use and maintain these systems under the conditions for their safe, effective use.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI can also empower patients and communities to assume control of their own\n",
    "healthcare and better understand their evolving needs. To achieve this, patients and communities require assurance that their rights and interests will not be subordinated to the powerful commercial interests of technology companies or the interests of governments in surveillance and social control. It also requires that the potential of AI to detect risks to patient or community health is incorporated into health systems in a way that advances human autonomy and dignity and does not displace humans from the centre of health decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI systems must be carefully designed to reflect the diversity of socioeconomic and healthcare settings and be accompanied by training in digital skills, community engagement and awareness-raising. Systems based primarily on data of one group of individuals may not perform well for others."

    "# Core Ethical AI Principles\n",
    "The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified six core principles to promote the [ethical use of AI for health](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240029200). These principles are intended to guide developers, users and regulators in improving and overseeing the design and use of such technologies. Human dignity and the inherent worth of humans are the central values upon which all other ethical principles rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Protect **autonomy**.\n",
    "2. Promote human **well-being**, **human safety**, and the **public interest**.\n",
    "3. Ensure **transparency**, **explainability**, and **intelligibility**.\n",
    "4. Foster **responsibility** and **accountability**.\n",
    "5. Ensure **inclusiveness** and **equity**.\n",
    "6. Promote AI that is **responsive** and **sustainable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement these principles and human rights obligations into practice, all stakeholders (designers, programmers, providers, patients, and governments) must work together to integrate ethical norms at every stage of a technology’s design, development, and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Protecting human autonomy.** Use of AI can lead to situations in which decision-making power could be transferred to machines. The principle of autonomy requires that the use of AI or other computational systems does not undermine human autonomy. In the context of health, this means that humans should remain in control of healthcare systems and medical decisions. Respect for human autonomy also entails related duties to ensure that providers have the information necessary to make safe, effective use of AI systems and that people understand the role that such systems play in their care. It also requires protection of privacy and confidentiality and obtaining valid informed consent through appropriate legal frameworks for data protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Promoting human well-being and safety and the public interest.** AI technologies should not harm people. The designers of AI technologies should satisfy regulatory requirements for safety, accuracy and efficacy for well-defined use cases or indications. Measures of quality control in practice and quality improvement in the use of AI over time should be available. Preventing harm requires that AI not result in mental or physical harm that could be avoided by use of an alternative practice or approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **<span style=\"color: red;\">Ensuring transparency, explainability and intelligibility.</span>** AI technologies should be intelligible or understandable to developers, medical professionals, patients, users and regulators. Two broad approaches to intelligibility are to improve the transparency of AI technology and to make AI technology explainable. Transparency requires that sufficient information be published or documented before the design or deployment of an AI technology and that such information facilitate meaningful public consultation and debate on how the technology is designed and how it should or should not be used. AI technologies should be explainable according to the capacity of those to whom they are explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fostering responsibility and accountability.** Humans require clear, transparent specification of the tasks that systems can perform and the conditions under which they can achieve the desired performance. Although AI technologies perform specific tasks, it is the responsibility of stakeholders to ensure that they can perform those tasks and that AI is used under appropriate conditions and by appropriately trained people. Responsibility can be assured by application of regulatory principles upstream and downstream of the algorithm by establishing points of human supervision. If something goes wrong with an AI technology, there should be accountability. Appropriate mechanisms should be available for questioning and for redress for individuals and groups that are adversely affected by decisions based on algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **<span style=\"color: red;\">Ensuring inclusiveness and equity.</span>** Inclusiveness requires that AI for health be designed to encourage the widest possible appropriate, equitable use and access, irrespective of age, sex, gender, income, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability or other characteristics protected under human rights codes. AI technology, like any other technology, should be shared as widely as possible. AI technologies should be available for use not only in contexts and for needs in resource-rich settings. AI technologies should not encode biases to the disadvantage of identifiable groups, especially groups that are already marginalized. Bias is a threat to inclusiveness and equity, as it can result in a departure, often arbitrary, from equal treatment. AI technologies should minimize inevitable disparities in power that arise between providers and patients, between policy-makers and people and between companies and governments that create and deploy AI technologies and those that use or rely on them. AI tools and systems should be monitored and evaluated to identify disproportionate effects on specific groups of people. No technology, AI or otherwise, should sustain or worsen existing forms of bias and discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Promoting AI that is responsive and sustainable.** Responsiveness requires that designers, developers and users continuously, systematically and transparently assess AI applications during actual use. They should determine whether AI responds adequately and appropriately and according to communicated, legitimate expectations and requirements. Responsiveness also requires that AI technologies be consistent with wider promotion of the sustainability of health systems, environments and workplaces. AI systems should be designed to minimize their environmental consequences and increase energy efficiency. That is, use of AI should be consistent with global efforts to reduce the impact of human beings on the Earth’s environment, ecosystems and climate. Sustainability also requires governments and companies to address anticipated disruptions in the workplace, including training for health-care workers to adapt to the use of AI systems, and potential job losses due to use of automated systems.\n",

It can be hard to distinguish between these reasons, especially since they are not mutually exclusive and often exacerbate one another.\n",

    "Demographic parity is a fairness metric whose goal is to ensure a machine learning model’s predictions are independent of membership in a sensitive group. In other words, demographic parity is achieved when the probability of a certain prediction is not dependent on sensitive group membership. In the binary classification scenario, demographic parity refers to equal selection rates across groups. For example, in the context of a resume screening model, equal selection would mean that the proportion of applicants selected for a job interview should be equal across groups. In the context of AKI prediction in critical care settings, **the selection rate will be the proportion of patients predicted to be at high risk of AKI**. Demographic parity is also sometimes referred to as *independence*, *group fairness*, *statistical parity*, and *disparate impact*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failing to achieve demographic parity could generate allocation harms. Allocation harms occur when AI systems allocate opportunities, resources, or information differently across different groups (for example, an AI hiring system that is more likely to advance resumes of male applicants than resumes of female applicants regardless of qualification). Demographic parity can be used to assess the extent of allocation harms because it reflects an assumption that resources should be allocated proportionally across groups. Of the metrics described in this section, it can be the easiest to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operationalizing fairness using demographic parity rests on a few assumptions:\n",
    "* Either the dataset is not a good representation of what the world actually looks like (e.g., a resume assessment system that is more likely to filter out qualified female applicants due to an organizational bias towards male applicants, regardless of skill level)\n",
    "* Or, the dataset is an accurate representation of the phenomena being modeled, but the phenomena itself is unjust (e.g., consider the case of predictive policing, where a system created to predict crime rates may correctly predict higher crime rates for certain areas, but simultaneously fail to consider that those higher rates may be caused by disproportionate policing and overcriminimalization of those areas).\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, these assumptions may not be the true. The dataset might be an accurate representation of the phenomena itself, or the phenomena being modeled may not be unjust. If either assumption is not true, then demographic parity may not provide a meaningful or useful measurement of the fairness of a model’s predictions."

    "The goal of the equalized odds fairness metric is to ensure a machine learning model performs equally well for different groups. It is stricter than demographic parity because it requires that the machine learning model’s predictions are not only independent of sensitive group membership, but that groups have the same false positive rates and and true positive rates. This distinction is important because a model could achieve demographic parity (i.e., its predictions could be independent of sensitive group membership), but still generate more false positive predictions for one group versus others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equalized odds does not create the selection issue discussed in the demographic parity section above. For example, in the hiring scenario where the goal is to choose applicants from group A and group B, ensuring the model performs equally well at choosing applicants from group A and group B can circumvent the issue of the model optimizing by selecting applicants from one group at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classifier satisfies equalized odds if its performance is the same regardless of group membership. In other words, equalized odds requires that the **true positive rate** (the proportion of patients who developed AKI and were classified as high risk) and the **false positive rate** (the proportion of patients who did not develop AKI but were predicted as high risk) be equal across groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inclusion of false positive rates acknowledges that different groups experience different costs from misclassification. For example, in the case of a model predicting a negative outcome (e.g., probability of recidivating) that already disproportionately affects members of minority communities, false positive predictions reflect pre-existing disparities in outcomes across minority and majority groups. Equalized odds further enforces that the accuracy is equally high across all groups, punishing models that only perform well on majority groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about equalized odds is to contrast it with demographic parity.

    "> **⚠️ Caution:** Explainable artificial intelligence (so-called *XAI*) is an important and highly active area of research. We note in passing the immense popularity of many post-hoc explainability methods (such as [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), which are general-purpose techniques that can be evaluated on almost any trained model. Such methods typically rely only on model inputs and outputs as oppposed to any type of internal mechanisms or logic.\n",

    "> The accuracy and actionability of such methods has been debated in recent years, with some researchers claiming that these techniques are misleading, inconsistent, and potentially harmful.<sup><a href=\"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/kumar20e.html\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01602\">2</a></sup> Until future studies provide clarity, we recommend developers and users exercise caution when reading into feature importance scores and other model explanations in healthcare settings."
