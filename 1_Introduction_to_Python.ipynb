    "    1. Select (click) the cell, and click the ▶️ button to the left of the cell to execute the code.\n",
    "    2. Select the cell, and press `Control + Enter` (on Mac, `Command + Enter`)\n",

    "\n",
    "Below are the steps to creating your first Python function. A function must be defined before it can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Begin the definition of a new function with `def`, followed by an appropriate name for the function.\n",
    "2. Then, add parentheses `()` after the function name.\n",
    "3. Inside the parentheses, list any number of **input arguments**, separated by commas `,`, that your function will use (many functions take **no arguments**).\n",
    "4. Add a colon `:` after the closing parentheses.\n",
    "5. If you want the function to output something, add a `return` statement, followed by the variable or expression you want to return. A `return` statement is not necessary!\n",
    "6. **Important:** All code inside a function must be **indented** using tab or four spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a simple function that takes as input two numbers, and outputs the sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(x,y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "```\n",
